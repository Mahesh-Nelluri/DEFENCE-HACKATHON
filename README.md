### Naval Underwater Waste Detection System

🌊 **OceanGuard AI** is an intelligent monitoring dashboard designed to detect and track underwater waste in naval and coastal environments.  
The system enables faster identification of hazardous debris, helping protect marine ecosystems and improve naval operational safety.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Underwater waste poses serious threats to:

- Naval vessels and submarines  
- Marine biodiversity  
- Coastal environments  
- Shipping routes  

### Key Challenges:
✅ Lack of real-time monitoring  
✅ High cost of manual inspections  
✅ Hidden underwater hazards  
✅ Environmental damage  

👉 There is a critical need for an intelligent system that improves detection speed and accuracy.
